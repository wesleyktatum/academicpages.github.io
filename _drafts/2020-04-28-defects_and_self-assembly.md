# Motivation

$\pi$-Conjugated polymers (CP) are a class of organic electronic materials. Extended lattices of alternating double and single-bonds allow charge carriers to delocalize along the backbones of the polymers. Overlapping of these delocalized orbitals in co-facial backbones allows charges to transfer between polymer chains as well as along the backbone. Many different physical properties of CP areaffected by their chemical structure. This allows these materials to be made dissolvable in common organic solvents. As a result, thin films of semiconducting CP can printed using techniques like blade-coating or roll-to-roll printing. This means electronic devices made from CP can be cheaply and scalably made. Thin films of these materials can also be flexible or even stretchable. What's more the thin film structure and intrinsic mechanical properties of CP allows devices made from them to be flexible or even stretchable. This allows the manufacture of devices that can bend, stretch, and wrinkle â€“ meaning they can be worn on clothing or directly applied to skin, like in the image below.

Because of their exciting and tunable properties, CP are the subject of a lot of research. However, one large goal in the field is to establish scalable methods of patterning or crystallizing these materials to improve their electronic properties. This is because many CP are mixtures of crystalline and amorphous domains. The long, worm-like CP backbones can either stack together nicely, or be a tangled, twisted mess. It's well known that the extent to which CP tend to show semi-crystalline (ordered) or amorphous (disordered) behavior is influenced by the chemical structure of the polymer. This includes the chain length and variety of chain lengths present in the sample, it also includes the chemical structure of the monomer and different functional groups and structures. Through these levers, the strength of the inter and intramolecular forces can be tuned, which in turn influence the crystallinity and morphology of the bulk polymer.

This work examines the influence that synthetic defects have on self-assembly of a well known CP, poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT). 

# The Work We've Done

In devices, thin films have crystalline and amorphous domains whose sizes are determined by many different factors. If we were able to identify factors that influence those final dimensions of these domains, then the thin film morphology would be far more controllable. This work investigates methods for controlling crystalline domains with chemical structure defects that are common to many different CP, specifically regioregularity and end-groups. Regioregularity is a measure of how many monomers incoporated into the polymer facing the correct direction. Regiodefects occur with a monomer is incorporated backwards and results in a distortion of the backbone's linearity. This is known to drastically disrupt electronic properties in bulk devices, without significant changes to the crystalline structure. Similarly, when a bulky end-group, such as bromine, is used, crystallinity and electronic properties see a significant decrease. Finally, because end-groups are a defect, short chains are as well because they result more end-groups in the sample. To investigate how these defects influence crystallinity and the P3HT lattice, self-assembled nanowires of P3HT were used, so that analysis could focus solely on crystalline domains, rather than including large amorphous domains.

Self-assembly of P3HT through the whisker method, where a poor solvent for P3HT is heated and supersaturated with P3HT. As it is slowly cooled and allowed to settle, the dilute solution precipitates highly ordered seed crystals. From these seeds, chains fold and stack with other chains to create nanowires that are only around 5 nanometers tall and 20 nanometers wide. This corresponds to 2 unit cells tall, and ~50 monomer units wide. However, these nanowires can be micrometers in length, allowing the formation of networks of highly crystalline P3HT with enhanced electronic properties.

By analyzing the crystallographic dimensions of these nanowires with precisely altered concentrations of regiodefects and end-group defects, we were able to observe differences in long-range and short-range order that validate bulk observations of CP behavior. These dimensions were measured through complementary analysis of X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and atomic force microscopy. Using these observations, we were able to directly alter crystallinity and grain growth of the nanowires. Regiodefects incur the least distortion of the crystal lattice and are therefore easily incorporated into the structure, affecting electronic properties at concentrations as low as 2%. However, morphological changes are not observed until >5% regiodefects were present. Sterically bulky end-groups, however, had a much larger effect on crystallinity. Bromine's ionic radius is approximately the same as the lattice spacing in P3HT and therefore severely deforms the lattice. This can be mitigated by using end-groups that can $\pi-\pi$ interact with the lattice, such as toluene.

Of note, we observed that despite different concentrations of defects in the nanowires, the width and height of the nanowires remained the same, with only grain size (length) changing. The width of the nanowires corresponds to ~50 monomers, so by synthesizing a series of P3HT with chain lengths corresponding to 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 monomer units, we showed that chains with integer multiples of the nanowire width were highly crystalline, while non-integer multiples forced the end-groups to be incorporated into the lattice, disrupting order.

These are useful result for a few main reasons:
- Defects can be strategically implanted into the crystal lattice, altering crystallinity or grain growth mechanisms
- End-groups can be chosen to alleviate lattice strains they impose. $\pi-\pi$ interacting end-groups in particular mitigate this strain the most
- The width of the nanowires is shown to be independent of intrinsic defects to the polymer structure, instead persistence length of the polymer backbone is shown to be more important

# The Next Steps

Work by our lab (though not by myself) is now taking this further. Can we synthetically introduce defects to alter this crystalline width? Preliminary results say yes! So, through careful synthesis, we can create semiconductors with intrinsically prefered crystalline dimensions and intermolecular interactions. All that's left is a way to tune the size and structure of the amorphous fraction. This is also being investigated by our lab, so I'll let those coming papers speak for themselves.

abstract = {Poly(indacenodithiophene-benzothiadiazole) has received significant interest because of its exceptional hole mobility despite its near-amorphous thin-film morphology and brittleness at low Mn. In comparison, poly(indacenodithiophene-benzopyrollodione) (PIDTBPD) has a lower hole mobility but is exceptionally ductile at similar Mn. Herein, we synthesize random indacenodithiophene (IDT) copolymers with varying amounts of incorporated benzothiadiazole and benzopyrollodione (BPD), which introduces varied degrees of backbone twist to each respective polymer system. This allows us to elucidate how the BPD monomer introduction leads to conformational and morphological changes that influence the crack onset strain (CoS) and hole mobility of these near-amorphous IDT copolymers and the rates by which each material property responds to sequentially larger BPD incorporation. Results of density functional theory calculations suggest that BPD introduction does not lead to significant differences in backbone linearity between the studied polymers, and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering demonstrates that the degree of crystallinity within thin films is not significantly altered. It does, however, lead to a more varied circular distribution of the hexadecyl side chains around the polymer backbone. With increasing BPD incorporation, a crossover point between CoS and hole mobility emerges. At this crossover point, a random copolymer with 30{\%} BPD introduction displays increased CoS and an average hole mobility value equal to that of the PIDTBPD system, suggesting that hole mobility is more sensitive to torsion along the polymer backbone, while the response of the CoS is relatively delayed. The data also suggest that the increase in CoS with increasing BPD content does not arise because of differences in rigidity but because the more circular distribution of the side chains makes polymer chains with sufficient BPD content better able to flow.},

abstract = {Alternating donor–acceptor copolymers are important materials with readily tunable optical and electronic properties. Direct arylation polymerization (DArP) is emerging as an attractive synthetic methodology for the synthesis of these polymers, avoiding the use of prefunctionalized building blocks. However, challenges remain in achieving well-defined structure, high molecular weight, and impurity-free polymers. Herein, a study to synthesize three well-defined donor–acceptor copolymers through DArP is presented. Comparison of 1H NMR and 13C NMR, as well as optical and electrochemical properties analysis for the polymers and corresponding oligomers provides evidence for the regioregular structure of the polymers. On the basis of the chemical structure of poly(IIDCBT) and the solution electrochemical studies we surmised poly(IIDCBT) could potentially be an electron transport material for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), and we determined an electron mobility of 1.2×10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for this material.},

abstract = {Ultrasound acoustic waves are demonstrated to assemble poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) chains into nanofibers after they are fully dissolved in what are commonly considered to be 'good' solvents. In the absence of ultrasound, the polymer remains fully dissolved and does not self-assemble for weeks. UV-vis spectroscopy, ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) are used to characterize the induced assembly process and to quantify the fraction of polymer that forms nanofibers. It is determined that the solvent type, insonation time, and aging periods are all important factors affecting the structure and final concentration of fibers. The effect of changing polymer regio-regularity, alkyl chain length, and side chain to thiophene ratio are also explored. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) fields of variable intensity are utilized to reveal the physical mechanisms leading to nanofiber formation, which is strongly correlated to cavitation events in the solvent. This in situ HIFU cell, which is designed for simultaneous scattering analysis, is also used to probe for structural changes occurring over multiple length scales using USAXS and SANS. The proposed acoustic assembly mechanism suggests that, even when dispersed in 'good' solvents such as bromobenzene, dichlorobenzene and chloroform, P3HT chains are still not in a thermodynamically stable state. Instead, they are stabilized by local energy barriers that slow down and effectively prevent crystallization. Ultrasound fields are found to provide enough mechanical energy to overcome these barriers, triggering the formation of small crystalline nuclei that subsequently seed the growth of larger nanofibers.},

abstract = {This work seeks to understand the role of structural defects in the polymer chain on the crystallization and crystal lattice of $\pi$-conjugated polymers, which is crucial for being able to predict morphology and performance of $\pi$-conjugated polymer active layers in optoelectronic devices. Such a predictive understanding of device performance has been difficult to establish; however, in this work self-assembled nanowires of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) are used to reduce analytical contributions from amorphous domains, allowing a more direct path to probe the effect of regio-defects and chain end-groups on the crystal lattice. By use of P3HT synthesized to have precisely varied defect concentrations, it was demonstrated that these defects can be incorporated into the crystal lattice, particularly regio-defects. However, this incorporation comes with a decrease in electronic properties as a result of diminished short-range order and lattice distortions. Bulky end-groups can be incorporated into the lattice, al...},

abstract = {A series of alkyl-substituted indacenodithiophene (alkyl-IDT) semiconducting donor–acceptor polymers were designed by DFT to have varying degrees of backbone planarity and synthesized via direct arylation polymerization (DArP). These polymers exhibit weak intermolecular interactions, a glass transition temperature (Tg) below room temperature, and low degrees of crystallinity from XRD measurements. Despite this, the field-effect mobilities ($\mu$) of these polymers are relatively high (0.06–0.20 cm2 V–1 s–1) with mobility increasing with increasing backbone planarity. Because of the weak intermolecular interactions, the polymers exhibit low elastic moduli (Ef) of less than 450 MPa. The polymer with the most twisted backbone exhibits high ductility with a crack-onset strain (CoS) over 100{\%}. These structure–property relationship studies provide useful guidelines for designing semiconducting polymers with high mobility, low stiffness, and high ductility enabling applications in stretchable electronics.},

Hi! My name is Wesley K. Tatum. I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Washington, in the department of Materials Science and Engineering. My research focuses on a few key topics:

- Clean energy materials and organic semiconductors
- Materials characterization and crystallization
- Data engineering and machine learning

My projects range from understanding structural influences of molecular self-assembly, to computer vision for atomic force microscopy. My first love is materials engineering and device physics. Through my graduate experience, I found that I also enjoy exploring how materials data can be used with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. I believe that physically-guided applications and interpretations of machine learning models will be key in the next era of scientific research, and I want to contribute to that evolution. Check out my github page to see my side-projects, published libraries, and research.

In addition to research, the UW has given me a lot of opportunities for passion projects. I have been a committed member and officer of two different registered student organizations, one of which I helped found (GRID):


- *Global Renewables Infrastructure Development* [(GRID)](https://sites.uw.edu/grid/) : As co-founder and first lead officer, I helped establish infrastructure and projects for an international collaboration focused on co-creatively developing best practices for off-grid solar energy systems. We have installed these kits in rural, agricultural, and at-risk regions of the world. GRID students have installed over 40 solar kits in different parts of Guatemala. We also conducted surveys of the families during and weeks after their installation, to identify new uses, problems, and to help troubleshoot the systems. This work stems from prior work with Prof. Lilo Pozzo, of the UW, in Puerto Rico to evaluate solar energy's ability to facilitate in-home medical devices during post-hurricane black-outs (_e.g._ CPAP, insulin refrigeration, feeding tubes, oxygen concentrators).

- *Diversity in Clean Energy* [(DICE)](https://www.cei.washington.edu/education/dice/) : A student group focused on providing professional and personal development opportunities for the UW community. We have planned and hosted workshops, luncheon events, symposiums, and networking events, bringing at least 15 external industry or academic speakers to UW each year.

Outside of the office, I'm usually found cooking or climbing with my wife, or playing D&D with my friends.

Hi! My name is Wesley Tatum. I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Washington. I'm an experimentalist turned data scientist and my interdisciplinary research focuses on a few key topics:

- Machine learning for materials analysis and microscopy
- Electronic materials and organic semiconductors
- Natural Language Processing models for text-mining
- Optoelectronic device processing and performance

My interdisciplinary background makes me uniquely qualified to lead research teams. I love being interdisciplinary because it allows me to approach problems and applications from completely different viewpoints. By having a diverse range of expertise, I'm able to design and complete projects whose solutions require different disciplines. Throughout my research, I've led and worked within teams, allowing me to learn from others and to clearly communicate project milestones and results. I'm a quick-learning self-starter that has a passion for working on teams to find innovative solutions.

In addition to research, the UW has given me a lot of opportunities for passion projects. I have founded student groups and been a committed member and officer of different registered student organizations, one of which I co-founded.

Outside of the office, I'm usually found cooking, hiking and climbing with my wife, running with my dog, or playing D&D with my friends.
